# grainsizeaggregator
Python script that aggregates grain size CSVs into a single CSV. Each grain size
CSV has three columns. The second column of each file contains the data
of interest. Each column is extracted as a row, and combined with 
the first column of any file (it should be identical in all files),
which is used as a header row.
